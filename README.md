# Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the Iris flower classification task using the Random Forest Classifier.

## Task Overview

The goal of this project is to classify Iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements. We use a machine learning approach with the Random Forest Classifier to achieve this classification.

## Files

- `Iris.csv`: The dataset containing sepal and petal measurements of Iris flowers.
- `Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the code and detailed explanations.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Iris Flower Classification.ipynb`.
4. Follow the step-by-step code and explanations to understand the workflow.
5. Execute the notebook cells to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the Random Forest Classifier, and evaluate the model's performance.
6. The notebook includes data exploration and visualization to provide insights into the Iris dataset.

## Results

- The notebook displays the model's accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix, indicating how well the model performed in classifying Iris flowers.
